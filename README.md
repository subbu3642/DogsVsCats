This is Capstone project 2 part of SpringBoard curriculum. 


Image classification is used to recognize the objects or species in an image. The dataset is obtained from Kaggle through Microsoft Research team who acquired it from Asirra (Animal Species Image Recognition for Restricting Access). Asirra in partnership with petfinders.com assists in finding home for homeless pets. The dataset was originally used as a CAPTCHA (or Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart), that is, a task that it is believed a human finds trivial, but cannot be solved by a machine, used on websites to distinguish between human users and bots. Specifically, the task was referred to as “Asirra” or Animal Species Image Recognition for Restricting Access, a type of CAPTCHA. The task was described in the 2007 paper titled “Asirra: A CAPTCHA that Exploits Interest-Aligned Manual Image Categorization“.
